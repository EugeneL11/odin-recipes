        <br />
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven broiler. Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. 
                    Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly 
                    and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in water and 
                    taco seasoning mix; simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet. Top with Cheddar cheese, 
                    then dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.</li>
                <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Top 
                    nachos with olives, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and jalapeño peppers.</li>
            </ol>
